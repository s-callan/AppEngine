# Simon's website

Welcome to my little place on the internet. At the moment, there is very little
here, but I plan to gradually add more stuff as time goes by.</p>

Currently, we have:</p>

*   The [Well of Lost Plots](./WellOfLostPlots/), which is a sort
    of external memory where ideas are laid to rest until they rise from the grave.</p>

*   [Things Past](./ThingsPast/), where I place various bits of stuff I have completed.

*   [Things Present](./ThingsPresent/), where I list some of the stuff
    I'm currently working on.

*   [Things To Come](./ThingsToCome/), where I wibble about things that I might be doing.

*   My [CV](./Professional/Simon_Callan_CV.html).
