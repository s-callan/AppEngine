# Things Past

## an archive of various things

## Always Wear Sunscreen

One of the new people at an earlier place work asked my advice about life, his career and just about
anything else I could think. After I got over him making me feel old, I wrote
[this](./AlwaysWearSunscreen.htm).

## Introduction to Fashion Design

This was a short course, that I did because it it was pretty much the sort of thing
that I wouldn't do.

## Introduction to Fashion Drawing

This had been intended to be a straight drawing course, but the original course
got cancelled, and I got moved to the Fashion Drawing.
