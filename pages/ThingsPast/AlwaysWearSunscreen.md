# Always wear sunscreen

## Introduction

This is mostly a list of things to consider, drawn from things I have read, things
I have done and things I should have done. There is a good chance that a lot of
this is wrong.

## Planning the future

What do you want to be doing in the future? Consider 6 months time, a year's
time, 5 years, 10 years and when you retire. You should probably consider both your
professional and personal lives, as these are related.

### Professional

Do you wish to stay in computing or do you wish to do something else? If you stay
in computing, do you with to stay a technical person, or move into a managerial
role? Are there any particular areas of computing that you wish to get involved
with or avoid? Web based stuff, compilers, protocols?

### Personal

This is probably harder to plan, but consider things like where you wish to live
(England, India?), and what interests you outside work. Are you interested in art,
music, rock climbing, etc?

## Personal life

Remember, work to live, don't live to work.

Don't spend too long in any job, but don't leave too soon.

Take all your holiday, and have at least one long holiday each year - 2 weeks
or more.

When you leave work, forget work. For a significant chunk of your time, forget computers.

There are times to think of nothing but computers. There are times to think of any
but computers.

## Technical skills

Apart from a few items, there are not many specific skills that I consider necessary.
You really need the flexibility to adapt to the new stuff as it comes along. Fads
come and go; the ability to cope is permanent.

### Programming

Programming wise, I would recommend learning C++/C#/Java. Learn one of these to
the near-expert level, and the others to the point where you can understand and
maintain reasonably complex programs.

Learn other languages, including at least one non-OO / procedural one, and a scripting
language. Amongst those worth considering are Python (my language of choice), a
functional language (Haskell is the one I recall, but there are loads around), Flash.

There are a number of useful utilities and IDE's around. Find some useful
ones, and learn them (Try Eclipse or Antlr).

Learn a Source Code Control System. Understand why a SCCS is essential.

Automated testing. In my opinion, as much testing as possible should be fully automated,
so learn about things such as unit tests, etc.

### Keep up to date

Keep up to date with the latest ideas, even those you don't agree with. There
are lots of blogs out there from respected people.

Ideas to consider are extreme programming, etc. Find writers who you agree with,
and writers that you disagree with.

Learn stuff that is unrelated to what you are doing at work. This is for 2 reasons.
By the time you start using it at work, it's probably rather late to start
learning and if you only know what you need for your current work, you'll
only do your current work.

A lot of the stuff you will find useful is in books, so keep an eye out for good
ones. These do not have to be related to computing.

This is a rather arbitrary list of books that only have one thing in common -
I own copies of them.

* The design of everyday things - Donald A. Norman.
* Joel on software - Joel Spolsky.
* Don't make me think - Steve Krug.
* Design Patterns - Gamma, Helm, et al.
* CRC card book - David Bellin, Susan Simone.
* Pragmatic Programmer - Andrew Hunt, David Thomas

### Design

Learn how to write requirement, design and test documents, and write them. Among
the stuff you might want to learn about are:

*   CRC cards.
*   Design patterns.
*   User interface design.
*   Use cases.
*   Unit tests.

## Non technical skills

These are probably just as important as the technical skills, and have the advantage
of not going out of date.

### Writing

Arguably, the code you produce at the end is a minor part of what we do. It's
really all about communication - with yourself, with your co-workers, with
the people who use the software and finally, the computer. As such communication
and writing skills are very important.

Practise your writing. Write anything, documentation, stories, poetry. The only
real requirement is that it should be in English.

### Management skills

Even if you don't want to go in to management, it's probably worth learning
some of what your manager has to do - project planning, time management, staff
management, inter-personal skills, etc. At the very least, you'll know where
he's going wrong.

### Random stuff

Do things that are totally unrelated to computers, things that just sound fun. They
will give you a different perspective on all sorts of stuff.

I've done "Fashion Design", "Fashion Drawing" and "Graphic Design" courses
for no other reason than they were fun.

### Practise

A good place to practise stuff is with open source projects. Choose some that look
interesting, and volunteer. Don't stick with just the code, try helping with
the documentation, etc. Even if you cannot add to the project, studying how they
work is useful.

## Misc stuff

>   Take wrong turns. Talk to strangers. Open unmarked doors. And if you see a group
>   of people in a field, go find out what they are doing. Do things without always
>   knowing how they'll turn out.
