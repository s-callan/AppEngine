# Well of Lost Plots

Welcome to the Well of Lost Plots, the part of my memory where ideas are laid to
rest until they rise from the grave.

The current selection of ideas floating around, waiting to be resurrected, are:

*   [Lost and found](./LostAndFound/): a web comic of sorts.

*   [Mail Mangler](./MailMangler/): a program for collecting and
    sorting mail. Mainly written as an exercise in design and C#.

*   [Untitled](./Untitled/): An as yet unnamed program that acts
    as a common front end to all sorts of social sites, such as LiveJournal, Flickr,
    Twitter, etc. As with Mail Manger, this is mainly a learning exercise.

*   My Evil Twin: Another web comic, that currently consists of little more than a
    single sentence concept.
