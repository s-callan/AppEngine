# Lost and Found

# A web-comic

# by Simon Callan

Being the trials and tribulations of the dedicated staff of the lost and found office
at Mornington Crescent underground station. A story of terror, confusion and missing
umbrellas, with a full cast of humans, non-humans and flatulent pachyderms.

## Cast - Good guys

### Stephanie

The boss. Generally in control of things, but while she is not fazed by the big
things like the end of the world, she can be thrown into a panic by suggesting that
the inventory has been messed up. This is, of course, due the the end of the world
being a minor incident, while if some of the things in the inventory get lost, really
bad things can happen, like an audit.

### Dave

General technical support, and member of the Dave conspiracy. Dave's main job
is to figure out what the weird stuff they pick-up does, and stop them doing it.
In addition, he provides the support equipment used by the rest of the team. As
such he is a mixture of Igor, Q and Mad Scientist.

By blood-line and training, Dave is an Igor, though he really wants to be a Mad
Scientist. Due to being a known Igor, he cannot get himself on the register of mad
scientists, so he has registered his boss, and Nelly intercepts most of Mad Scientist
literature, and passes it on to him.

Whenever he goes out on a collection, he has a habit of getting himself killed by
accident, but his body quickly disappears, and he turns up perfectly healthy a few
minutes later. Deliberate attempts to kill him almost always fail, in some humorous
way. Dave claims this is because as well as being an Igor, he has McCavity and super-villain
in his ancestry.

### Nelly

An intelligent elephant, whose main job is secretarial. Nelly was found somewhere
on the underground system, though the true story of how an elephant can be found
on the Underground is never revealed. Instead, every time the question comes up,
a different, wildly improbable, story is told.

### Charles

Charles is the person who actually goes out and collects the odd things that get
found. It's a job he has been doing for quite some time (he started before
any of the others), and as a result is very blase about the things that happen.
He's been transformed into so many different, horrible, forms that his only
response to transmogrification is a rather tired curiosity as to what he has been
turned into this time.

Despite the rules, he has a habit of "borrowing" transmogifiers when he wants to
have a bit of fun. This usually causes most problems at Halloween.

### Sharon

The new employee. Young, curious, hyper-active and very fit.

## Cast - bad guys 

So far, I don't have any, though I'm sure I can come up with a few.

## Environment 

## Story lines 

### Recruitment

The story of how Sharon get recruited, and her introduction to the group.

### First collection

Charles takes Sharon out on her first collection of a found Item. Chaos and confusion
ensues.

### The many deaths of Dave

Since Dave has the habit of not staying dead, we can have fun killing him off in
a variety of manners.

We start with a teaser strip. "The following story is a harrowing tale, with
many twists and turns, and a completely unpredictable denouement. Welcome to 'The
death of Dave'.

#### Strip 1

1.  Totally black box, with white text - "The following story is a harrowing
tale, ..."
2.  Totally black box, with white text - "with many a twist and turn, and a completely
unpredictable outcome. Welcome to ..."
3.   White box, max size text "The death of Dave"

#### Strip 2 

 
1.  We see Dave falling into the depths of something, screaming
2.  We see Dave fall onto a sharp spike, surrounded by black and white circles.
3.  Cut to the back view of an unknown person, looking over a ledge, down to where
    Dave is impacted on the spike. From up here, the circles look like a target. "Bullseye!"
 

#### Strip 3
 
1.  A simple caption. "A few moments earlier ..."
2.  Side view. Dave is hanging over a cliff with only one hand holding him up. The
    stranger from the previous strip is standing on the cliff top.
3.  Tight view on Dave, and the hand holding him up. A boot comes down hard on his
    hand.
 

At this point, we cut away to a totally new strip, where Dave does not appear for
several days, and when he does, we make no reference to the death.

In 3.2, can I get away with the line "Dave, I am your ...", and then cut
it off at that point? Or should it be "Dave, I am your <random, totally
irrelevant relationship>"?

In subsequent deaths, we title the sequence, "The many deaths of Dave III",
etc. In each on, we kill Dave on in some way that normally the hero of the story
would survive. I.e., consider Indiana Jones, Dave would fall off the rope bridge
when it collapsed, and when the fridge opens all we would see is Dave's jellified
body.

### Inventory

Someone has check the inventory, and ensure that it is up to date. Guess what, it
isn't and there is all sorts of un-inventoried stuff floating around.

### Affair

Charles and Nelly appear to be closer than just colleagues. What is going on, and
can I involve Nelly's trunk in a rather tasteless blow job joke?
